Module 3 challenge Bootstrap portfolio

## How have I used Bootstrap?

##### for Navbar:

- This creates a navigation bar with a dark background.
  navbar-expand-lg ensures that the navigation bar expands to the full width on screens.
- fixed-top keeps the navigation bar fixed at the top.

##### for Navigation links

- The navigation links are organized using a Bootstrap unordered list class navbar-nav.
- mr-auto moves the navigation links to the right.

##### for jumbotron Header

- This creates a jumbotron header with a secondary background color and light text color.
- The jumbotron-fluid class ensures that the header stretches to the full width of the viewport.

##### for Cards

- I have used Bootstrap's card component for each project.
  The cards are styled with images, titles, descriptions, and links to my GitHub repositories.

##### for Contact

- The contact buttons are styled using Bootstrap's btn class and given a dark color.

### The Responsive Design

- Bootstrap's grid system is used throughout the code to create responsive and consistent layouts. I have used classes such as col-lg-4, col-md-6, and mx-auto to control column widths and to center content.
